abstract = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,062 new measurements from 721 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. All the particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, DarkMatter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 117 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including new reviews on Pentaquarks and Inflation. The complete Review is published online in a journal and on the website of the Particle Data Group (http://pdg.lbl.gov). The printed PDG Book contains the Summary Tables and all review articles but no longer includes the detailed tables from the Particle Listings. A Booklet with the Summary Tables and abbreviated versions of some of the review articles is also available.},

abstract = {A search for a standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair and decaying to bottom quarks is presented. Events with hadronic jets and one or two oppositely charged leptons are selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5[Formula: see text] collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in [Formula: see text] collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8[Formula: see text]. In order to separate the signal from the larger [Formula: see text] + jets background, this analysis uses a matrix element method that assigns a probability density value to each reconstructed event under signal or background hypotheses. The ratio between the two values is used in a maximum likelihood fit to extract the signal yield. The results are presented in terms of the measured signal strength modifier, [Formula: see text], relative to the standard model prediction for a Higgs boson mass of 125[Formula: see text]. The observed (expected) exclusion limit at a 95 {\%} confidence level is [Formula: see text] (3.3), corresponding to a best fit value [Formula: see text].},

abstract = {A search for the standard model Higgs boson (H) decaying to b b-bar when produced in association with a weak vector boson (V) is reported for the following channels: W(mu nu)H, W(e nu)H, W(tau nu)H, Z(mu mu)H, Z(e e)H, and Z(nu nu)H. The search is performed in data samples corresponding to integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 inverse femtobarns at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV and up to 18.9 inverse femtobarns at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC. An excess of events is observed above the expected background with a local significance of 2.1 standard deviations for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV, consistent with the expectation from the production of the standard model Higgs boson. The signal strength corresponding to this excess, relative to that of the standard model Higgs boson, is 1.0 +/- 0.5.},

abstract = {We analyze the extent to which the LHC and Tevatron results as of the end of 2012 constrain invisible (or undetected) decays of the Higgs boson-like state at {\~{}} 125 GeV. To this end we perform global fits for several cases: 1) a Higgs boson with Standard Model (SM) couplings but additional invisible decay modes; 2) SM couplings to fermions and vector bosons, but allowing for additional new particles modifying the effective Higgs couplings to gluons and photons; 3) no new particles in the loops but tree-level Higgs couplings to the up-quarks, down-quarks and vector bosons, relative to the SM, treated as free parameters. We find that in the three cases invisible decay rates of 23{\%}, 61{\%}, 88{\%}, respectively, are consistent with current data at 95{\%} confidence level (CL). Limiting the coupling to vector bosons, CV, to CV {\textless} 1 in case 3) reduces the allowed invisible branching ratio to 56{\%} at 95{\%} CL. Requiring in addition that the Higgs couplings to quarks have the same sign as in the SM, an invisible rate of up to 36{\%} is allowed at 95{\%} CL. We also discuss direct probes of invisible Higgs decays, as well as the interplay with dark matter searches.},

abstract = {A search for direct top squark pair production in pp collisions at √ s = 13 TeV is performed using events with a single isolated lepton, jets, and large transverse mo-mentum imbalance. This analysis closely follows the strategy of a similar search for the same signature in 2015, using data collected in 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with the CMS detector and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb −1 . No significant excess in data is observed above the expectation from stan-dard model processes. Exclusion limits are set in the context of supersymmetric mod-els with pair production of top squarks that decay either to a top quark and a neu-tralino or to a bottom quark and a chargino.},
