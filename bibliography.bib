A welcome by-product of the method is the straightforward and efficient generation of unweighted next-to-leading order events.

If fully stable, the Standard Model (SM) can be extended all the way up to the inflationary scale and the Higgs field, nonminimally coupled to gravity with strength $\xi$, can be responsible for inflation. We show that the successful Higgs inflation scenario can also take place if the SM vacuum is not absolutely stable. This conclusion is based on two effects that were overlooked previously. The first one is associated with the effective renormalization of the SM couplings at the energy scale MP /$\xi$, where MP is the Planck scale. The second one is a symmetry restoration after inflation due to high temperature effects that leads to the (temporary) disappearance of the vacuum at Planck values of the Higgs field.},

abstract = {A new general purpose algorithm for multidimensional integration is described. It is an iterative and adaptive Monte Carlo scheme. The new algorithm is compared with several others currently in use, and shown to be considerably more efficient than all of these for a number of sample integrals of high dimension (n 2 4). 1. I{\~{}}VTRODUCTION One of the most important computational problems facing physicists today is the evaluation of multidimensional integrals with complicated and sometimes very poorly behaved integrands. To cite but a single example drawn from elementary particle theory, integrals over four or more variables are routinely encountered in the computation of scattering amplitudes using Feynman perturbation theory [I]. In this note a new algorithm for multidimensional integration is described. It employs an iterative and adaptive Monte Carlo scheme. Among the characteristics of this algorithm are: (a) A reliable error estimate for the integral is readily computed. (b) The integrand need not be continuous for the algorithm to function and, in particular, step functions pose no problem. Thus integration over hypervolumes of irregular shape is straightforward. (c) The convergence rate is independent of the dimension of the integral. (d) The algorithm is adaptive. It automatically concentrates evaluations of the integrand in those regions where the integrand is largest in magnitude. Characteristics (a)-(c) are common to all Monte Carlo methods [224]. Characteristic (d) is the single most important feature of this algorithm. The major problem in multidimensional integration is the exponential growth with increasing dimension of the integration volume over which the integrand must be sampled. For example, applying any five-point integration rule (e.g., Gauss-Legendre integration) along each coordinate axis of a nine-dimensional integral requires 5g -2 x IO6 evaluations of the integrand-a formidable number for all but the simplest integrands. Thus any},

The method relies on a re-organization of phase space for the real radiation contributions, defining a one-to-many map such that each point in the real phase space is associated with a distinct Born topology. As a result virtual and real singularities cancel at each Born phase space point. The new phase space maps can be used in a traditional approach for NLO calculations. However, interesting applications arise when one instead integrates out the real radiation up to a specified scale. This allows one to define NLO weights for individual phase space points that are present at LO. This method allows for the extension of matrix element methods to next-to-leading order, even in the presence of jets.

The capability of the method is examined for simplified models of events including one- and two-missing massless particles. It is shown that (a) when events are well identified, dynamical parameters involved in the process canbe determined, and (b) in new particle searches, narrow mass spectrums are obtained.},

In the standard model, the largest number of events is expected when h ! b " b, giving rise to a W þ W {\`{A}} b " bb " b signature, deluged in t " t þ jets. A promising strategy to improve the sensitivity is to maximally exploit the theoretical information on the signal and background processes by means of the matrix element method. We show how, despite the complexity of the final state, the method can be efficiently applied to discriminate the signal against combinatorial and t " t þ jets backgrounds. Remarkably, we find that a moderate integrated luminosity in the next LHC run will be enough to make the signature involving both W's decaying leptonically as sensitive as the single-lepton one.},

abstract = {A search for a standard model Higgs boson produced in association with a top-quark pair and decaying to bottom quarks is presented. Events with hadronic jets and one or two oppositely charged leptons are selected from a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19.5[Formula: see text] collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC in [Formula: see text] collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 8[Formula: see text]. In order to separate the signal from the larger [Formula: see text] + jets background, this analysis uses a matrix element method that assigns a probability density value to each reconstructed event under signal or background hypotheses. The ratio between the two values is used in a maximum likelihood fit to extract the signal yield. The results are presented in terms of the measured signal strength modifier, [Formula: see text], relative to the standard model prediction for a Higgs boson mass of 125[Formula: see text]. The observed (expected) exclusion limit at a 95 {\%} confidence level is [Formula: see text] (3.3), corresponding to a best fit value [Formula: see text].},

Events are considered where the top-quark pair decays to either one lepton+jets (t tbar to ell nu q q' b bbar) or dileptons (t tbar to ell(+) nu ell(-) nu b bbar), ell being an electron or a muon. The search is optimized for the decay mode H to b bbar. The largest background to the t tbar H signal is top-quark pair production with additional jets. Artificial neural networks are used to discriminate between signal and background events. Combining the results from the 7 TeV and 8 TeV samples, the observed (expected) limit on the cross section for Higgs boson production in association with top-quark pairs for a Higgs boson mass of 125 GeV is 5.8 (5.2) times the standard model expectation.},

abstract = {We analyze the extent to which the LHC and Tevatron results as of the end of 2012 constrain invisible (or undetected) decays of the Higgs boson-like state at {\~{}} 125 GeV. To this end we perform global fits for several cases: 1) a Higgs boson with Standard Model (SM) couplings but additional invisible decay modes; 2) SM couplings to fermions and vector bosons, but allowing for additional new particles modifying the effective Higgs couplings to gluons and photons; 3) no new particles in the loops but tree-level Higgs couplings to the up-quarks, down-quarks and vector bosons, relative to the SM, treated as free parameters. We find that in the three cases invisible decay rates of 23{\%}, 61{\%}, 88{\%}, respectively, are consistent with current data at 95{\%} confidence level (CL). Limiting the coupling to vector bosons, CV, to CV {\textless} 1 in case 3) reduces the allowed invisible branching ratio to 56{\%} at 95{\%} CL. Requiring in addition that the Higgs couplings to quarks have the same sign as in the SM, an invisible rate of up to 36{\%} is allowed at 95{\%} CL. We also discuss direct probes of invisible Higgs decays, as well as the interplay with dark matter searches.},
